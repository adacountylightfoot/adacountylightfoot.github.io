Today is the day that we commemorate the [Battles of Lexington and
Concord][battles], and the brave minutemen who died there in our defense in
1775. In their memory, the Real 3%ers of Idaho held a ceremony on the Capitol
steps. Lt Gov. Janice McGeachin, as acting governor, administered to all
modern-day minutemen in attendance an oath of Constitutional allegiance.
