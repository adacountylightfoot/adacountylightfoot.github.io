Today is the day that we commemorate the [Battles of Lexington and
Concord][battles], and the brave men who died there in 1775 initiating the
defense that ultimately freed us from King George III. In their memory, the
Real 3%ers of Idaho held a ceremony on the Capitol steps behind the Liberty
Bell. Lt Gov. Janice McGeachin, as acting governor, administered to all in
attendance an oath of defense and allegiance to the Constitutions of the State
and of the Union.
