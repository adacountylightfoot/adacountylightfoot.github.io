Today is the day that we commemorate the Battles of Lexington and Concord, and the brave men who died there in 1775 to free us from King George III. We owe much to them. In their memory, the Real 3%ers of Idaho held a ceremony on the Capitol steps with special guest Lt Gov. Janice McGeachin, who is currently serving as our acting governor.
