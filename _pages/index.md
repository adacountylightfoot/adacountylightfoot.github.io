In accordance with the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of the State of Idaho, [ARTICLE XIV][articleXIV], and Idaho Statute, in [Title 46][title46]; we are an _Unorganized Militia_ consisting *MORE* volunteers. We are the 43rd infantry battalion of the Unorganized Militia of the State of Idaho, based in Ada County. 

## Our Mission

> To defend the Constitution of the United States and the State of Idaho from all enemies, foreigh and domestic. In time of peace, we train and assist our community in any way that may better us all. A Primary goal is to work and train to be an asset and not an issue for the Sherrif's office. In time of crisis, we stand with our neighbors to protect live, liberty and property and ensure the rule of law.

We pledge to promote and defend the unalienable rights of all people as directed by the U.S. Constitution, the Idaho Constitution, and our Commander in Chief, the Governor of Idaho. If you support this cause, then consider yourself recruited. [More About Us][about]

## You are the Militia!

You may say "I don't have any training!" or "What can I do?" To be a "Well-Regulated Militia..." we must and will train all members and the public. Those from military or law enforcement, we need your help to train others. Those without training still have skills or hobbies that can be useful. The Militia requires Integrity, Courage, and Strength of Character. As a member, you will be charged with devending your fellow man, helping those in need, facint disaster, and taking a stand when it is much easier to continue to do nothing.

## How to Join

According to the U.S. Constitution, Federal Law, the Idaho State Constitution and Idaho State Code, all male citizens ages 18-45 years are members of the militia. According to Anglo-Saxon Common Law, and the laws and customs of the American Colonies before our separation from the British Empire, all males (and even females during an actual emergency) between the ages of 16 and 60 were considered members of the militia.

So the militia, like your God-given rights, existed before the United States government was formed. And as such, you are already a member of the militia, by statute and by God-given right. [How to join][join]
