We are your friends, your neighbors, and your co-workers. In many cases, we come from a military or law-enforcement background. We believe in God, liberty, and the Constitution. Our members operate under a code of conduct and are self reliant. We care about our country, our community, and our fellow man. We have come together for purposes of preparedness and as first responders in an emergency situation. **We are "Neighbors Standing Together"**

## Statement of Ethics

It is the duty of the citizen's militia to protect and defend the unalienable Rights of all members of the community. Under no circumstances will the militia tolerate those who advocate acts of criminal violence, terrorism or a change away from our republican form of government; nor will it support any specific political party or candidate, nor espouse any particular religious denomination or doctrine. All members must understand the duties and obligation of both citizens and government under the United States and their state's constitution.

## Mission Statement

The members of the unorganized militia shall ever stand, as have our forefathers before us, first to God, from whom we acknowledge the authority of all rights, and all the blessings of governments and to our native state.

## Standards

As a Light Foot battalion, we base our operations on the [Militia Standards and Principles of the Light Foot][standards]. These standards are the foundation of our unit, as well as many other Light Foot units throughout the country.

## WE DO NOT:
 
* Promote the overthrow of any government, local, state, or national. 
* Advocate or promote violence against any organization, group, or individual. 
* Advocate the removal of any person from his or her lawfully elected office. 
* Allow racists, felons, or anarchists to join or participate.
