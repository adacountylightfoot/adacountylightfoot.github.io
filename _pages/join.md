General membership in the militia is open to all lawful citizens of a state, ages 16 and up. There shall be no discrimination due to race, sex, national origin or physical characteristics.

## Familiarize yourself with the standards

As a Light Foot battalion, we base our operations on the [Militia Standards and Principles of the Light Foot][standards]. We expect participants to be familiar with these standards, and abide by the guidelines set forth therein. Please download and print a copy. You're not expected to **memorize it**, but at least familiarize yourself with it before attending your first meeting, especially the _Statement of Ethics/Mission Statement_ section on page 1, and the _Duty and Code of Conduct_ on page 3.

## Application Process

All prospective members must submit an application online. This information will help us to determine elegibility and appropriate role in the unit. Submitting an application **does not** constitute membership in the battalion. After submitting an application and eledgibility is determined, prospects will be invited to attend our regular monthly meetings. This is an opportunity for us to get to know you, and for you to ask any questions.

## Attend a meeting

We ask new recruits to attend one of the public monthly meeting before they attend any of our Field Training Excercises (FTX). At the meeting you will have an opportunity to meet others, introduce yourself to the the officers, and ask questions. We meet on the first Tuesday of each month in Meridian, at 7pm. Because the meetings are held on private property, we disclose the location to prospective members upon completion of the application and vetting interview.

## Enlist in the unit

All prospective members shall be required to give their name, date of birth, address,contact information, next of kin and general information detailing prior military experience and/or other such skills as may be utilized by the militia.

Additionally, at the time of enlistment, prospective members shall be required to provide proof of a background check, or show a current CCWP issued by the State of Idaho.

## Prepare

As a new recruit, you are not expected to show up in a "full kit" on day one. Take a deeper look at the [Militia Standards and Principles of the Light Foot][standards] document, and familiarize yourself with the equipment that you'll need. You don't need **everything** right away, pick up gear as you can afford it, and as you learn what works for you and what doesn't. The only **ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE** is an Individual First Aid Kit (IFAK), that someone else can use to treat **YOU** if you're wounded. This is required to be **ON YOUR PERSON** at all times during an FTX. 

## Train

We encourage everyone to train as often as possible. Our monthly FTX is one opportunity, but individuals, and small teams should ideally be training once or twice per week! As you attend meetings and trainings, you'll meet others who live close to you; we encourage you to train together as a small group. [Learn more about Training][training]

Beyond the basic requirements of an enlisted militiamen, we there are many ways to contribute. These opportunities range from teaching a class or conducting a training, helping to recruit at local meetings, and assisting during events. If you have something to contribute,  speak up.
