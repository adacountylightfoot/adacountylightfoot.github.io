# Ada County Light Foot
1st Battalion, 43rd Field Force, United States Militia

We are a volunteer infantry unit of the Unorganized Militia of the State of
Idaho, based in Ada County.

## Why "Light Foot"?
We in the “Patriot Movement” like tradition.
Up until the late 18th / early 19th century, British infantry units were called "Foot" (foot soldiers).
As in, the "13th Regiment of Foot". Light infantry was called “Light Foot”.
Cavalry was called "Horse", heavy cavalry was "Heavy Horse", for example, the "48th Regiment of
Horse".
As we will not have much in the way of supply lines or support elements, we will most likely "live
off the land, resupply off the enemy", so to speak. Carrying what we need on our backs through the
mountains and hills. Light = Fast.
Hence, the "Light Foot” militia or "Light Foot", for short (Idaho Light Foot, Utah Light Foot, etc).

Our unit patch in all states is a circular green patch (or tan, depending on
the camo pattern of your uniform) with a Spartan helmet and crossed short
swords. Above is "Come and get them" in Greek. Pronounced "Molon Laveh".  It is
a famous quote from ancient military history. It was uttered by Leonidas (King
of Sparta) to Xerxes (King of Persia) during the battle of Thermopylae, when
Xerxes ordered Leonidas... "Lay down your arms!"
Leonidas' reply will live in history... "Come and get them!"

According to the U.S. Constitution, Federal Law, nearly all state constitutions and state
code, all male citizens ages 18-45 years are members of the militia. According to Anglo-Saxon
Common Law, and the laws and customs of the American Colonies before our separation from
the British Empire, all males (and even females during an actual emergency) between the ages of
16 and 60 were considered members of the militia. So the militia, like your God given rights,
existed before the United States government was formed. And as such, you are already a member
of the militia, by statute and by God-given right.
