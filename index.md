# Who is the Ada County Light Foot?
We are a volunteer infantry battalion of the Unorganized Militia of the State
of Idaho, based in Ada County. We meet on the first Tuesday of each month in
Meridian, at 7pm, on the upper level of the [Veterans Memorial Building][map].

We pledge to promote and defend the unalienable rights of all people as
directed by the U.S. Constitution, the Idaho Constitution, and our Commander in
Chief, the Governor of Idaho.
